- Part 1: Linear Regression
  - Loss functions
  - Gradient descent
  - Linear regression as a neural network
  - First look at pytorch

- Part 2: Logistic Regression
  - Why linear regression doesn't work for classification
  - Sigmoid
  - Logistic loss
  - Logistic regression as a neural network
  - Activation functions

- Future topics:
  - ReLU
  - Adam
  - pytorch (properly)
  - Regularisation
  - Transfer learning
  - CNNs
  - Transformers
  - Workflow (project structure, experiment tracking etc.)
  - GPUs / HPC / VMs etc.
  - Back propagation
